# CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs in Python

CS61A at UC Berkeley is the introductory course for CS majors. It focuses on **abstraction**, **recursion**, and **problem solving**. Besides divide-and-conquer, it uses abstraction to manage complexity (how to organize large code?).

The [MIT SICP](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/) is taught in Scheme programming language. CS61A at UC Berkeley adapts it and teach it in Python. You can use Python REPL and there are two online editors. One is [CS61A Code](https://code.cs61a.org/) and the other [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/) for visualization of program execution. Another adaption is [SICP in JavaScript from NUS](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/index).

Follow the schedule of [CS61A 2024](https://insideempire.github.io/CS61A-Website-Archive/) or [the latest CS61A](https://cs61a.org/).

Even [without the autograder OK.py](https://okpy.org/), you could follow [the CS61A textbook](https://www.composingprograms.com/) and complete all code from slides, discussions, labs, homework, and projects.  

Here is [the MIT SICP textbook](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html).

* if CS61A is difficult, try [CS10](http://cs10.org/) first, never give up.
