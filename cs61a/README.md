# CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs in Python

The MIT SICP is taught in Scheme programming language. CS61A at UC Berkeley adapts it and teach it in Python. Along with Python REPL, there are two online editors avaible. One is [CS61A Code](https://code.cs61a.org/) and the other [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/) for visualization of program execution.

Follow the schedule of [CS61A 2024](https://insideempire.github.io/CS61A-Website-Archive/) or [the latest CS61A](https://cs61a.org/).

Even [without the autograder OK.py](https://okpy.org/), you could follow [the CS61A textbook](https://www.composingprograms.com/) and complete all code from slides, discussions, labs, homework, and projects.
