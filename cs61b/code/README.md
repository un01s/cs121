# Java code examples

There are IDEs. You could just install JDK so that all the code in Java could be built and run.

## 01. hello world

```
$ which javac
/usr/bin/javac
$ javac --version
javac 21.0.5
$
$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld
Hello, World!
```

Compiler: javac
interpreter: java

## 02. Hello numbers

```
$ javac HelloNumbers.java 
$ java HelloNumbers 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

variables and while-loop

* x must be declared before it is used, and it must be given a type, that is ```int```
* Java is a statically typed language. It means that all variables, parameters, and methods must have a declared type.
