## lecture1: intro, great ideas

computer architecture: hardware-software interface, what the programmer needs to know to achieve the highest possible performance, programming languages like C are closer to the underlying hardware.

6 great ideas in computer architecture

* abstraction
* Moore's law: 2x transistors/chip every 2 years
* principle of locality/memory hierarchy: registers, cache, RAM, flash, etc.
* parallelism: fetch-decode-execute-pipeline
* performance measurement & improvement
* dependability via redundancy
